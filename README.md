# hello-world
 This repository is for practicing the Github flow


I am Dustin Phan, a computer science student at CSULB hoping to improve my skills.
I am trying to balance this microinternship with my job search and midterms,
so I hope this isn't too much of a bother for you.
I want to be a game developer in the future so I already know several game engines.
